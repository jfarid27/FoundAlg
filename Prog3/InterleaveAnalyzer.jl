module InterleaveAnalyzer
#=
    A Julia implementation of the logic for programming assignment 3.
    This module exposes data wrapper objects to store state data,
    as well as runner functions to test whether a given string t is an
    interleaving of strings x and y, called by

        The DFA is a structure to store transitions data for a given string. When

        to.
