# Programming Assignment 2

## Code

This code implements median of three quicksort, as well as quicksort with pivot
on the last element. Some detailed functions are below. Note methods that modify
input parameters are ended with `!`.

#### medianOfThree!

A function that modifies the given input a and sorts using Median of Three
quicksort.

#### quicksort!

A standard quicksort implementation that selects the last element as the pivot.

#### runWithRandoms

A function that, when given an array of integers i:j, runs, for each k in i:j
100 samples of random permutations of integers from 1 to k. Each sample is then
copied and ran on quicksort and median of three, and the average of each is
computed and added to a store array. The store arrays for both median of three
and quicksort is returned.

## Running and Plotting Output 

Included in the file is a file called main.jl. Start the julia repl and run

`include("main.jl")`

This is required since the program requires plotting libraries to plot the output.
If you do not wish to verify the code, the output is produced and saved as MOTvsQS.png.
The plotted output is generated using Plotly.js, so some interactivity is included.
