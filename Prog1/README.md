## Programming Assignment 1

This project is written in the Julia language. Install the language, then note the module is
written in Main.jl. Tests are included in test.jl, and running them will run test examples
that ensure some basic assertions, along with test cases for the main function required
by the assignment ```insert```. Note here, this is a functional language, so there is a
separation between methods and objects; the MySet struct we create only contains data, and
the functions that operate on the MySet type are separate from MySet.

## Testing

```bash julia test.jl```
